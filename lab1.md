## Trying Some Commands

Now that we are remotely connected to a computer in the CSE basement, we can execute a variety of commands. Here are some example commands and their descriptions:

- `ls`: Lists the files and directories in the current directory.
- `cd`: Changes the current directory.
- `cat`: Displays the contents of a file.
- `sudo`: Executes a command with superuser (administrator) privileges. (have used this previously)

You can try these commands and explore the file structure of the server. Here are some screenshots of running the `ls` command on the specified directory:
